# ATX Food Scores

## Problem

Texas law doesnâ€™t require establishments to post their inspection scores. A way indviduals can look up establishment inspection scores in austin is on the governments site. But, it is hard to find and not user friendly.


## Solution

Develop an application that can inform users about restaurant inspection scores, in a user friendly way. Gather inspection scores from the source (atx gov), and other useful information from yelp. Allow users to create an account (google login), and save favorite restaurants.

# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
