# ATX Food Scores

## Problem

Texas law doesnâ€™t require establishments to post their inspection scores. A way individuals can look up establishment inspection scores in austin is on the governments site. But, it is hard to find and not user friendly.


## Solution

Develop an application that can inform users about restaurant inspection scores, in a user friendly way. Gather inspection scores from the source (atx gov), and other useful information from yelp. Allow users to create an account (google login), and save favorite restaurants.

Application developer
 
---------------------------------

# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
